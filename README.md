# Dog_cat-Image-Classification
TEST PYTHON

This project is a small-scale image classification application implemented in Python, focused on distinguishing between images of cats and dogs.

## Overview

The project consists of two main Python scripts:

- `main.py`: The primary script for running the image classification tasks.
- `model_1.py`: Contains the `ImageClassifier` class, which handles data loading, feature extraction, training, and prediction.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- scikit-learn (`scikit-learn`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Run the main.py script to train the classifier and make predictions.
